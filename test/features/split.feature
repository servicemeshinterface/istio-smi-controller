Feature: split.smi-spec.io
  In order to test the TrafficSplit
  As a developer
  I need to ensure the specification is accepted by the server

  @split
  Scenario: Apply alpha1 TrafficSplit
    Given the server is running
    When I create the following resource
    ```
      apiVersion: split.smi-spec.io/v1alpha1
      kind: TrafficSplit
      metadata:
        name: trafficsplit-sample
      spec:
        service: foo
        backends:
          - service: bar
            weight: 50m
          - service: baz
            weight: 50m
    ```
    Then I expect 1 Istio "VirtualService" named "trafficsplit-sample" to have been created
  
  @split
  Scenario: Apply alpha2 TrafficSplit
    Given the server is running
    When I create the following resource
    ```
      apiVersion: split.smi-spec.io/v1alpha2
      kind: TrafficSplit
      metadata:
        name: trafficsplit-sample
      spec:

            weight: 50
          - service: baz
            weight: 50
    ```
    Then I expect 1 Istio "VirtualService" named "trafficsplit-sample" to have been created
  
  @split @alpha3
  Scenario: Apply alpha3 TrafficSplit
    Given the server is running
    When I create the following resource
